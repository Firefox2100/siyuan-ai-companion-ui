# SiYuan AI Companion UI

A Flutter UI for [Siyuan AI Companion](https://github.com/Firefox2100/siyuan-ai-companion), featuring a chat interface and audio transcription controls.

## Usage

This project is written in Flutter. A pre-compiled version of this UI is bundled with the Siyuan AI Companion, in its data folder. The backend service will also serve the UI directly from the data folder. There's no need to manually serve this project directly, unless you have a large number of users that the ASGI Python app cannot handle.
